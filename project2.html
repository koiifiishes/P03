            <p>'The Guardian' is a personal illustration project representing the mythical creature, Kelpie, in its
                environment. </p>
            <p>This illustration was a challenge for myself back in 2021 to create an original piece of artwork every
                month focusing on mythical creatures. I find that mythical creates can be interpreted in a variety of
                ways so this allowed me to add a more personal touch to my illustrations. When working on this
                illustration, it took a lot of research in terms of anatomy, colour palette, environment of the
                background and the technique I wanted to apply to the illustration.</p>
            <p>Kelpie are horse-like creatures so I had to study some horse anatomy to familiarize myself. I took images
                of horses in the pose I wanted and created red lines to study the basic shape of each part of the horse.
                I later applied these shapes to my initial sketch and eventually used these guidelines to stylize the
                creature.</p>

            </div>
            <p>For the environment, I wanted the Kelpie to be in the middle of a body of water. I looked for inspiration
                on of swamps which consist of mostly blues and greens.</p>
