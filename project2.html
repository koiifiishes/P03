            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>'The Guardian' is a digital illustration depicting the Scottish mythical creature, Kelpie, resting on a lily pad on a river. It was created in 2021 as a part of a personal art challenge.</p>

            <div class="line"></div>
            <h3>The Problem</h3>

            <p>I wanted to challenge myself in 2021 to create a piece of original artwork every month focusing on mythical creatures. What drew me to me to attempting this challenge was becuase I found it fascinated how mythical creatures could be interpreted in a variety of ways. This made me want to dra so this allows me to add an extra personal touch to my illustrations. </p>
            <div class="line"></div>

            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            <p>Before working on this illustration, I had to do research in terms of anatomy, colour palette, environment of the background and the technique I wanted to apply to the illustration.</p>

            <h3 class="margin_top">Solution</h3>

            <h4>Research & Mood Board</h4>
            <p>Before starting my illustration, I found references to form a mood board as a basis for my drawing. The colour scheme I wanted to go with for this piece consists of many blues and greens, so I gathered references of swamps and river elements that showcase these colours. The collected references can be viewed individually here: <a href="https://www.pinterest.ca/koiifiishes/kelpie-reference/" class="in_text">https://www.pinterest.ca/koiifiishes/kelpie-reference/</a></p>

            </div>

            <p>I created my initial sketch to gather a sense of the composition I wanted for the illustration. After looking at the initial sketch, I was dissatisfied with the anatomy of the creature. So before proceeding further, I wanted to familiarize myself with horse anatomy because Kelpies were often described to resemble horse-like creatures. I collected images of horses in the pose I wanted and created red lines to study the basic shape of each part of the horse. I later applied these shapes to my initial sketch and eventually used these guidelines to create a stylized version of the creature that I was content with.</p>

            </div>

            <h4>Final Render</h4>
            <p>I start working on the background by laying down the foreground and background colours, using the photos from my mood board as reference. After finalizing the background colours, I work on the Kelpie's colours. The Kelpie started with dark blue hair and a light blue body. I eventually changed the body to be darker than the mane since the light blue body was similar in tone to the background which made it blend into the background. After all the colours had been finalized, I added lighting and shading to further refine the artwork. </p>

            <h3 class="margin_top">Reflection</h3>
            <p>I was proud of the outcome of 'The Guardian' because I was able to complete a full illustration that I was happy with. I don't create full illustrations often because I struggle with integrating characters with backgrounds. I felt that I captured the Kelpie in its environment perfectly. Its loneliness feels powerful, it is as if she is protecting her home and she's wary of the viewer as an intruder. If I were to make further improvements, I would add more detail to the background. I would like to add other small critters that may share their home with the Kelpie and show how they may interact with her. </p>
