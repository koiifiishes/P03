            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>'The Guardian' is a digital illustration depicting the Scottish mythical creature, Kelpie, resting on a lily pad on a river. It was created in 2021 as a part of a personal art challenge.</p>

            <h3>The Problem</h3>

            <p>I wanted to challenge myself in 2021 to create a piece of original artwork every month focusing on mythical creatures. What drew me to me to attempting this challenge was becuase I found it fascinated how mythical creatures could be interpreted in a variety of ways. This made me want to dra so this allows me to add an extra personal touch to my illustrations. </p>
            <hr>

            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            <p>Before working on this illustration, I had to do research in terms of anatomy, colour palette, environment of the background and the technique I wanted to apply to the illustration.
                What kind of limitations you were dealing with? Time? Resources? A new technology? Knowledge of the subject at hand?
            </p>

            <h3 class="margin_top">Solution</h3>

            <h4>Research & Mood Board</h4>
            <p>Before starting my illustration, I found references to form a mood board as a basis for my drawing. The collected references can be viewed individually here: <a href="https://www.pinterest.ca/koiifiishes/kelpie-reference/" class="in_text">https://www.pinterest.ca/koiifiishes/kelpie-reference/</a></p>

            </div>

            <p>I created my initial sketch to gather a sense of the composition I wanted for the illustration. After looking at the initial sketch, I was dissatisfied with the anatomy of the creature. So before proceeding further, I wanted to familiarize myself to horse anatomy because Kelpie were often described to resemble horse-like creatures. I collected iamges of horses in the pose I wanted and created red lines to study the basic shape of each part of the horse. I later applied these shapes to my initial sketch and eventually used these guidelines to create a stylize version of the creature that I was content with.</p>

            <h3 class="margin_top">Reflection</h3>

            <p>This illustration was a challenge for myself back in 2021 to create an original piece of artwork every
                month focusing on mythical creatures. I find that mythical creates can be interpreted in a variety of
                ways so this allowed me to add a more personal touch to my illustrations. When working on this
                illustration, it took a lot of research in terms of anatomy, colour palette, environment of the
                background and the technique I wanted to apply to the illustration.</p>
            <p>Kelpie are horse-like creatures so I had to study some horse anatomy to familiarize myself. I took images
                of horses in the pose I wanted and created red lines to study the basic shape of each part of the horse.
                I later applied these shapes to my initial sketch and eventually used these guidelines to stylize the
                creature.</p>

                <img src="img/process2_3.jpeg" class="flexbox_img img_third">
            </div>
            <p>For the environment, I wanted the Kelpie to be in the middle of a body of water. I looked for inspiration
                on of swamps which consist of mostly blues and greens.</p>
